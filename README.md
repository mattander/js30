30 JS projects for practice

I'm going to do the Wes Bos 30 JS projects because they seem fun.

Thanks, Wes, for sharing these!


## Process
I deleted all the solutions. I'll read the description of what I'm supposed to do, then try and accomplish it on my own.

If I get stumped, I'll watch some of the video to help me get over the obstacle.

I'll keep a log here of my progress and note when I needed to watch the video. Honour system, I promise I'll tell!
